	 | - Discussion of the precursor civilization
	 | - Book tells you what it's convenient for you to know, not everything there is to know
	 | - Setting seems to be a shore-horned-in aside
	 | - Book isn't shallow, but the reading doesn't impart that much value
	 | - Three stories going on - the Past, the Con, and the Stranger Comes To Town
	 | - Connection of Locke to the BBEG was weak
	 | - Book would make a great movie, but it wouldn't be a deep movie

	 | - Talk about the Don's bodyguard and how cool he was
	 | - Point that there weren't a lot of "lies" in the book aside from the con jobs
