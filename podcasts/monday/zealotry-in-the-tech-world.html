	 | - Antiquated laws can't keep up with current hobbies that produce trivial income

00:37:50 | Main Topic
	 | - There are fanboys in the world, specifically in the realm of technology
	 | - Rym: Religious debates were the first fanboy arguments
	 | - Discussion about how the Internet breeds fanboys about everything
	 | - Rym: Apple fanboys aren't on the radar when it comes to the GNU/Linux people
	 | - Scott postulates that the fanboys from Slashdot have migrated to Reddit
	 | - This is one of the things holding back open technology - when people refuse to compromise on stupid little things
	 | - Examples: Java libraries, perl versus python, emacs versus vi
	 | - Open source - example, the "purity" of Ubuntu and how it doesn't do X, Y, and Z
	 | - Wouldn't having something that just works be better than a half-assed solution?
	 | - Rym recounts a tale of a zealot for the Aladdin license
	 | - In open source, productivity almost always wins
	 | - There is an amount of work that is required, however
	 | - Younger tech workers don't care about the old zealotries but have new ones
	 | - New Zealots: GUI vs. Command Line, Mac vs. Windows
	 | - No, X doesn't suck, it only sucks for you in your specific situation.
	 | - The new technology is to blame for a lot of the new zealotries
	 | - The new abstractions have brought more superficial arguments into play
	 | - People are resistant to change even in the face of evidence of a better method
	 | - People should use the defaults and learn to change themselves
	 | - Dealing with zealots:
	 | - 1. Let them have their way or leave it up to the person in charge
	 | - 2. For the GNU/Linux type that would correct you to their way, just laugh at them and say "whatever"
	 | - 3. Fight zealotry with productivity
	 | - 4. Change yourself, not the computer
	 | - 5. Learn to adapt to what is required of you
	 | - Majority of developers out there are Java, but they don't know how to actually program
	 | - They just know Java - they are not coders, they are overly-specific
	 | - The majority of IT people out there are like this
	 | - Discussion of how schools try to teach CS and IT these days
	 | - Don't try to push your preference on anyone else
	 | - Don't be the zealot guy
