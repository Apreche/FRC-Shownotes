00:31:53 | Main Topic - Network Neutrality
	 | - Geeknights hasn't done a whole show on Net Neutrality before, but it has had mentions
	 | - Only tech professionals seem to properly understand it AND care about it
	 | - It doesn't say anywhere that networks have to remain neutral... BUT IT SHOULD!
	 | - There is no overall law governing the internet
	 | - The government could regulate the whole mess, but that means no more "wild west"
	 | - Most of the internet should be unregulated
	 | - Evil Companies and How much evil are you willing to put up with?
	 | - The law can't keep up with the speed of the internet
	 | - Professional Opinion Time: We need Network Neutrality, not Internet Neutrality
	 | - The base of the network should not be aware of the content residing on it
	 | - ISPs started getting snarky about who could send traffic across their networks
	 | - Analogy of how the internet works in comparison to hitch-hiking
	 | - We need a completely open, dumb baseline infrastructure
	 | - Discussion of Regulation of ISPs
	 | - Discussion of the real motivation behind the death of Napster, et al.
	 | - Discussion of "Why pirate now when you can get legal media for free?"
	 | - Discussion of Bandwidth Caps, Metering, and Reasonable Rates
	 | - The world where people have more bandwidth is the world where content providers can cut out the middleman
	 | - Data transport at the last mile and at the high ISP level should be data-agnostic
	 | - The Last-Mile providers should not be able to have content production capability
	 | - The ISPs should essentially be a utility
	 | - The problem with a la carte pricing in relation to net neutrality
	 | - Discussion of TV Production Houses, Advertisers, and other vested interests
	 | - The internet destroys all middlemen - only service/utility providers will remain
