00:07:51 | # What makes a GOOD RPG?
	 | - What are the things someone looks for in a good game?
	 | - Game needs Player Agency
	 | - Player has to be able to make meaningful choices and have effects on the world
	 | - - The ability to make irrational decisions as a player character
	 | - Player priorities are important as well 
	 | - - What the player wants to do shoudl be factored in
	 | - Game needs not just mathematical conflict resolution but also takes player choices into account
	 | - Choosing not to choose should still have consequences
	 | - The game should have a philosophy and it can either coincide or conflict with the player's philosophy
	 | - Jared: There are no characters in an RPG, there are only players
	 | - Rym notes that many players may internalize the role-play and only burst out for certain parts
	 | - Turtle = Player that just sits there and does nothing
	 | - Roach = Player that is active until the spotlight is on them
	 | - Discussion of players that have huge backstories for their characters
	 | - Note that players can make decisions within the framework of a character they have built
	 | - Note that "what my character does" can be somewhat schizophrenic and disassociate the player from the game.
	 | - Discussion of playing characters that don't fit with the game mechanic (e.g. pacifists, Deckers)
	 | - When is it the GM's part to address that versus a broken game mechanic?
	 | - Some games require certain you be a certain character in order to play the game
	 | - Discussion of how Political games don't work in D&D
	 | - Many games don't tell you how they work up front
	 | - Many players won't admit they are playing a game that's bad or poorly constructed

	 | - JRPGs fall prey to the Sunk Cost fallacy
	 | - Tangent into Jared met Roger Ebert, gave him a copy of octaNe and Against the Reich!
	 | - Tabletop RPGs allow for a greater degree of avatar embodiment
	 | - Tabletop RPG characters have memory and history, video game RPGs have levels and quest goals
	 | - How are characters in WoW not like tabletop RPG characters?
	 | - Jared: Because those characters don't have memories.
	 | - Luke: So do characters exist or not?
	 | - Jared: for an RPG the player's memory of the events and the character's memory are similar but disparate
	 | - Jared: The events that happen to the character are not the events that happen to the player
	 | - The character sheet is a record of the character's history that is filtered through the player

	 | - Luke won't ever do a Noir-themed RPG because people won't get into character
00:35:49 | # If role-playing is a natural emergent behavior, what is the purpose of a Role-Playing Game?
