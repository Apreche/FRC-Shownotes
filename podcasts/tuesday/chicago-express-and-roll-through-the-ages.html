00:29:13 | Main Topic
	 | = Chicago Express
	 | - Recounting of board game night
	 | - Game is flawed but has novel mechanics
	 | - Goal is to have the most money at the end
	 | - Players spend money to buy shares in different railroad lines
	 | - Discussion of game's mechanics and how to best screw your partners in the rail lines
	 | - Game can support a lot of high-level play but is not terribly balanced
	 | - It is possible to mathematically eliminate yourself but not be able to end the game
	 | - Fun game to play, but not highly recommended for purchase
00:39:13 | = Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age
	 | - Not related to Through the Ages
	 | - Game is very similar to Yahtzee in its randomness
	 | - Start with three dice, used to build resources (food, cities, developments, monuments)
	 | - Game is very much like a group solitaire
	 | - You try to score the most points before everyone else, but can't really have a major effect on anyone else
	 | - Can't be made very interactive because it messes with the endgame
	 | - Print-and-play expansion is available (Roll Through the Ages: The Late Bronze Age)
	 | - Expansion changes scoresheets, making the ones that come in the main box useless
	 | - Game is quick, easy to learn, and portable
	 | - Neither game discussed is perfect, but both are good
	 | - Discussion of the top-ten on BoardGameGeek
	 | - Discussion of more tactics & stratecy for Chicago Express
	 | - Reminder to game designers that game mechanics aren't copyrightable, so you can steal from the forgotten masters.
