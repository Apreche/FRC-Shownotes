	 | - Other Brian Lee O'Malley projects
	 | - Franchise has been handled very well
	 | - Discussion of how the news of the movie and other media were well-received by fans at large
	 | - Has been very true to the source books so far, very few complaints from the nerds
	 | - Discussion of Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim
	 | - Pre-release screenings are a great idea to help drive hype
	 | - Debate on how pre-release screenings work - who is paying for it?

00:32:20 | *** SPOILER LINE ***
	 | - Rym wasn't surprised when Scott died and came back due to the 1UP
	 | - Scott didn't re-read the volumes, so he forgot some details between releases
	 | - "The Glow" was present even back in volume one
	 | - Simon and the prelude came back in a big way at the end
	 | - Scott has a tendency to forget things that he and Rym view or read if there are gaps in the viewing
	 | - Rym was wrong about the glow - thought that it symbolized going back to the real world
	 | - Bleed over from other media where there is a magic world and a real world tinted Rym & Scott's view
	 | - How you view the world is affected by your own experiences
	 | - Is a cigar really a cigar or is it a metaphor?
	 | - The books are consistent both on the direct level and on the metaphorical level
	 | - Comparison of how the art has improved over the course of the book
	 | - Scott Pilgrim ranks above a lot of books and is as good as some of the better manga
	 | - Rym ranks it as a "B"
	 | - At the same level of Yotsuba&! and Azumanga Daioh
	 | - Scott Pilgrim is NOT a slice of life book - it has an overarching story
	 | - Discussion on Kim Pine & Knives Chau
	 | - Discussion on Gideon
	 | - Discussions on the other characters
	 | - Scott would take Young Neil over Knives Chau
	 | - Character interaction was very realistic
	 | - Some interaction seemed to be more about the supporting characters bouncing off Scott
	 | - The metaphors in the book weren't subtle, but they worked
	 | - Scott's problems in the book were very similar to problems other people in this generation may have had
	 | - Scott Pilgrim is NOT about Hipsters
	 | - Discussion of Hipsters and how people misunderstand the term

	 | - Why are people threatened by Hipsters?
	 | - Discussion of the ratio of trust-fund Hipsters to non-trust-fund Hipsters
	 | - Scott Pilgrim's band sucks at the end of the books
	 | - People who didn't get the ending missed the core message and just liked the action and video game events
	 | - Rym wagers that most people don't know what "Clash at Demonhead" really is
	 | - Knives' moment of closure was one of Rym's favorite parts
	 | - Discussion of how old games and media don't hold up to the test of time
	 | - Rym is looking forward to the movie about as much as NS2
